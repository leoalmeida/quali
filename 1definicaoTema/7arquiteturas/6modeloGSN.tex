\cite{LSIR-REPORT-2006-001}

The availability of cheap and smart wireless sensing devices provides unprecedented possibilities to monitor the physical world. On the technical side these devices introduce several original research problems, many of them related to the integration of the rampant technology proposals. Global Sensor Network (GSN) is a platform which provides a scalable infrastructure for integrating heterogeneous sensor network technologies using a small set of powerful abstractions. GSN supports the integration and discovery of sensor networks and sensor data, provides distributed querying, filtering, and combination of sensor data, and supports the dynamic adaption of the system configuration during operation through a declarative XML-based language
